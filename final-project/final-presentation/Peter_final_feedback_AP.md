**Notes:** <br>
- Instead of predicting prices up to the minute or second, I think focusing on your categorical (up/down/flat) outcomes might make more sense. <br>
- You now have experience in trying to tame pricing data from bitcoin, maybe you can apply these skills to a more ‘traditional’ asset such as equities/commodities and incorporate additional features into the model. www.data.gov has a ton of economic stuff you can use. <br>
- Here is a link to a decent blog that has to do with managing bitcoin volatility and using bitcoin options on various exchanges: [Hedging Bitcoin 101](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/hedging-bitcoin-101-managing-bitcoin-volatility-for-beginners)
