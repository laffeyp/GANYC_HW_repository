Will you simply use the past prices to do an analysis, or do you think there are additional sources of data that you can use to add dimension to your predictive model? Also, what time frame of data are you planning on using as your input into the model, and how far into the future would you like to predict? Perhaps you can engineer a few additional features (i.e. % price change of the past X time frame, and vary the size of X).
