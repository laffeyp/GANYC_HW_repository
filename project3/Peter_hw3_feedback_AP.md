Q1: A nice way to see the counts of admit/non-admit, for each prestige bucket is to try this:  pd.crosstab(df['admit'], df['prestige'], rownames=['admit'])
Q3.4: A more precise answer would be: For students who attended a top ranked college, the odds of being admitted into graduate school are 3.07 times the odds of students who did not attend a top tier school.
Q3.7: A more precise answer would be: For students who attended a 4th tier school the odds of being admitted into gradauate school are 0.41 times the odds of students who did not attend a 4th teir school.
For parts 4 and 5, this exercise wanted you to use the Statsmodel package, specifically the "Logit" model.
This blog would be very useful in understanding how to use that model and how to calculate the log odds out of the models coefficients: http://blog.yhat.com/posts/logistic-regression-and-python.html
