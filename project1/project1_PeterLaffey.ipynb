    "## Bonus Questions:\n",
    "1. Outline your analysis method for predicting your outcome\n",
    "    - We will need to use logistic regression or some kind of classification method, as the outcome we are attempting to determine is a binary variable. The Prestige variable will need to be dummified and one will need to be omitted from the regression to eliminate collinearity. \n",
    "2. Write an alternative problem statement for your dataset\n",
    "    - Interestingly, we could also attempt to predict the prestige of the school, given whether or not a candidate was accepted based on the GRE and SAT scores. \n",
    "3. Articulate the assumptions and risks of the alternative model\n",
    "    - The risk of this is that we do not know how the Presige measure was calculated, so we may be violating some statistical principles in attempting to predict it. We are assuming here that Prestige is quantifiable, as opposed to intangible in some sense. "
